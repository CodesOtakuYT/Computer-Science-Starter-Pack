Advice:
- Use open source software especially for your work unless if you have no other options (like a hardware driver, a social media platform, vscode, roblox and video games  ).
- Cross platform software are god sent.
- Learn Linux, and runaway from Windows as far as you can.
- Stay updated, and give every skill or tech a chance, you might love it!
- Learn something new at least every month.
- Build a social network.
- Errors are your friends, the problem is when you don't get an error and nothing works 
- Fail fast to learn faster
